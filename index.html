            My Dearest,

In the quiet moments when the world fades away, I find myself lost in the wonder of how we've both changed. Like the seasons that dance from spring to autumn, we've grown, shaped by love's tender hands. Your presence has become the soft rhythm to which my heart beats, and in you, I’ve found a home for my wandering soul.

Every day with you feels like a delicate thread, weaving the tapestry of our lives. I know there are times when I occupy more of your time than I should, but it's only because every second without you feels like a lifetime. Whether we create a grand castle or a humble cottage, it matters not, as long as I have you by my side.

We've walked through shadows and light, with the echoes of our sorrows still lingering in the night. Yet, even in our darkest hours, there’s a light that shines—a promise that no storm can extinguish. For no matter what trials we face, my heart remains steadfast, yearning only for you.

I dream of journeys across the world, where I'll sing your name to the stars and carve our love into the fabric of the universe. But even if those dreams take time to unfold, I am content, as long as I can hold your hand through it all.

As we continue to grow, I vow to temper my storms and become your shelter, while you find the courage to let your voice soar. Together, we will create a love that endures beyond time, a love that will remain until our final breath.

For the rest of our lives, my love, I choose you—today, tomorrow, and always.

Forever entwined with you.
        </br>
